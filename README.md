# Files
- `CodeBook.md.`: code book that describes the variables, the data, and any transformations or work that was performed to clean up the data.

- `run_analysis.R`: script performing the processment of the data as described in the code book

- `tidyDataSet.txt`: the tidy data set outputed by the script `run_analysis.R` - data set with the average of the features for each subject and activity. Please refer to `CodeBook.md.` for more explicit information.
